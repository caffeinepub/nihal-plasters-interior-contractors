  "summary": "Diff implements the WhatsApp-based Contact Form with client-side validation, expands services to seven offerings with anchors and SEO copy, updates address text in the footer, updates multiple page-level SEO titles/descriptions to the new company name, and aligns primary CTAs to “WhatsApp Now” and “Call Contractor”. Potential gaps remain around fully updating visible header/footer branding to the exact full company name everywhere and ensuring the required hero image asset is actually added.",

      "requirement": "Update all user-facing branding text to use the company name “Nihal Plasters & Interior Contractors” across all pages and shared layout components (not just SEO/copyright).",
      "reason": "The Header and Footer still display the visible brand as “Nihal Plasters” with a secondary line “Interior Contractors”, rather than the exact full company name as one string, so not all user-facing branding text appears updated to “Nihal Plasters & Interior Contractors”.",
