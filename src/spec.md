# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update branding, address/service-area details, expand services content, and add a WhatsApp-opening contact form for Nihal Plasters & Interior Contractors.

**Planned changes:**
- Update all user-facing branding text and SEO metadata across pages/components to “Nihal Plasters & Interior Contractors” (replacing “Interior Works”) without changing the existing theme/layout structure.
- Update Contact page + Footer address text and Google Maps embed to “Sattenapalli Road, Dharani Kota, Indian Gas Front, Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh, India”, and adjust service-area messaging on Contact + About to clearly state service is available all over India.
- Expand Services content and related navigation/links to include: PVC Ceiling, Gypsum Ceiling, POP Work, Wall Panels, False Ceiling, Interior Decoration, and Material Supply & Contract Work; ensure Home services quick-links and SEO descriptions reflect the full list.
- Add a luxury-styled Contact Form on the Contact page (name, phone, city, message/requirements) with client-side required-field validation; on submit, open WhatsApp to +91 7523029086 with a URL-encoded prefilled message including the form details; align primary CTA labels to include “Get Free Quote”, “Call Contractor”, and “WhatsApp Now” where appropriate.

**User-visible outcome:** The site shows the updated company name and location everywhere, lists the full set of services with working quick-links, and visitors can fill out a contact form that validates inputs and then opens WhatsApp with their details prefilled (plus updated, consistent CTA button labels).
